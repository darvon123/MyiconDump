#IconDump

Hello, well anyway this is dumping repository who whole purpose is to host icons/svg for draft projects.
There not much here but I plan to add to it. 
	**Current project:**
## A poor mans Read aloud
>	My attempt at making a injections script for text-to-speak .  — If you can tell from this I’m not the brightest tool in the shed
## Royal Road WebCrawler 
> My attempt at making a WebCrawler script that grabs my favorite chapters from the oh so creditable roadroad.com
## scribble Hub page turner 
> My attempt at making a auto page turner script that Just read my favorite chapters from scribbleHub.com ¬— If you can tell from this I’m kind of lazy.
